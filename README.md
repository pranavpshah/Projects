# Projects
## Brief about the projects:

### Classification models
Comaprison of performance of classifiers on time series data like WISDM Health Dataset

### Stereo Reconstruction
Two-view and Multi-view Stereo reconstruction

### Transformer model
Attention based network to perform Human Trajectory Prediction

### Variational Auto encoder
Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) for MNIST Dataset

### SLAM
LIDAR based SLAM using a Particle filter

### Ensemble Kalman Filter
Comparison of performance of difference types of Kalman filters with an Ensemble filter

### Model Predictive Control
Chance Constrained Multi-agent Non-linear Model Predictive Control

### VIO for UAV
A Visual-Inertial Odomentry (VIO) based autonomous quadcoptor simulation (TODO: Need to add code)
